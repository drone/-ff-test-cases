The door opened on to a tube­shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable\ntunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished\nchairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats ­ the hobbit was fond of visitors.

No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars,\npantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens,\ndining­rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms\nwere all on the left­hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows,\ndeep­set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the\nriver."
